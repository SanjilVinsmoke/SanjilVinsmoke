Hi, I am a Unity developer with 2 years of experience in creating 2D games. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Information Technology, which has given me a strong foundation in programming and computer science concepts.

In my time as a Unity developer, I have gained expertise in using C# and Unity to develop and implement game mechanics, animations, and user interfaces. I am also proficient in using tools such as Git for version control and project collaboration.

I am a proactive learner and always looking for opportunities to improve my skills and expand my knowledge. I am excited to continue developing my skills as a Unity developer and contribute to projects that push the boundaries of what is possible with the engine.
